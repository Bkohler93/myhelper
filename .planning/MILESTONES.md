# Milestones

## v3.2 Observability & Polish (Shipped: 2026-04-24)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases (21–23), 5 plans
**Files changed:** 19 files, +1,811 / -149 lines
**Timeline:** 2026-04-24 (single day)

**Key accomplishments:**

- `myhelper inspect` dry-run command wired to `BuildInspectContext` — per-stage gate/pre-filter/re-rank/metrics output; `--no-context` bypass; missing-artifacts detection (Phase 21)
- Goroutine-based terminal spinners at all 3 search pipeline waits (gate, fetch, re-rank) using stdlib only — zero new dependencies (Phase 22)
- SearXNG double-slash URL bug fixed; `llmReRank` error now named with explicit fallback to all candidates (Phase 23)
- Dead code eliminated: `countTokens` duplicate, `pkgs` param from `llmReRank`, `CallEdges`/`TypeRefs` documented as reserved-for-future (Phase 23)
- `microPassFile` uses stored `Symbol.Start/End` from artifacts — eliminates per-call AST re-parse for large files (Phase 23)

Known deferred items at close: 2 (see STATE.md Deferred Items)

## v3.1 Web Search (Shipped: 2026-04-11)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 4 plans, 3 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Standalone SearXNG HTTP client package (internal/search) with url.QueryEscape injection, result filtering, and env/file config resolution — all five SRCH requirements satisfied via TDD
- One-liner:

## v1.3 Structured Code Intelligence (Shipped: 2026-04-10)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases, 11 plans
**Files changed:** 77 files, +15,250 / -108 lines
**Timeline:** 2026-04-08 → 2026-04-10 (2 days)

**Key accomplishments:**

- `ExtractSymbolsFull` captures full symbol profile (kind, signature, line range, imports, call edges, type refs, stable IDs) for all exported Go symbols via go/ast (Phase 9)
- `init` and `sync` produce four layered artifact files (`project.json`, `packages.json`, `files.json`, `symbols.json`) replacing flat `index.json` with schema version field (Phase 10)
- Four-stage LLM retrieval pipeline (relevance gate → keyword pre-filter → LLM re-rank → dep expansion) in `internal/retrieval/` behind `BuildContext` entry point — 13 tests (Phase 11)
- Stage-aware token-bounded context assembly (`assembleMessages`) with per-command strategies — `plan` summaries-only; `starter` symbols+files; `lookup` minimal; `pattern` near-zero (Phase 12)
- `--no-context` flag, `inspect` dry-run command, and `--token-limit` wired via `ApplyFlagOverrides` across all four query commands (Phase 13)

### Known Gaps (accepted as tech debt)

- **RET-01–06** — Phase 11 missing VERIFICATION.md; implementation confirmed by downstream phase verifications and 13 unit tests
- **SYM-05, SYM-06** — `Symbol.CallEdges`/`TypeRefs` stored in `symbols.json` but not consumed by retrieval pipeline
- **IDX-03, RET-03** — `PackageEntry.Responsibility` written to `packages.json` but unused in `llmReRank`
- **CTX-01, CTX-02** — Dual context injection (`context.md` + `proj.Summary`) — same source, redundant tokens

## v1.2 Smart Context (Shipped: 2026-04-09)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases, 13 plans, 13 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- FileEntry/ChatFn type contracts, exclusion-aware Walk(), and go/ast-based ExtractSymbols() — scanner core primitives, 16 TDD-verified tests (Phase 5)
- Token-budgeted index assembler serializes `{"meta": {...}, "files": [...]}` to `.myhelper/index.json` via ReadMeta + BuildIndex, dropping test files first when 80% budget is exceeded (Phase 5)
- Per-package LLM summary generation and `scanner.Scan()` entry point completing the two-step scanner pipeline (Phase 5)
- `init` and `sync` commands rewritten with Bubble Tea `RunWithSpinner`, `generateContextMD` LLM-based context.md generation, and mtime-based delta rescan (Phase 6)
- `buildInjectedMessages` two-pass context injection helper with full token budget logic wired into all 4 query commands (plan, lookup, starter, pattern) (Phase 7)
- `microPassFile` AST symbol-map + LLM line-range micro-pass for large files, replacing symbol-block fallback in `buildInjectedMessages` (Phase 8)

### Known Gaps (accepted as tech debt)

- **CTX-01, CTX-02, CTX-04** — Phase 07 missing VERIFICATION.md; requirements are functionally wired (integration-verified) but not formally verified
- **SYNC-01, SYNC-02** — Phase 06 missing VERIFICATION.md; requirements are functionally wired (integration-verified) but not formally verified
- **ApplyFlagOverrides** absent from all 4 query commands — `--token-limit` flag silently no-ops on plan/lookup/starter/pattern
- **deltaIndex** re-uses stale `Index.Meta` — go.mod changes not reflected in index.json after sync until next `init`

## v1.1 Conversational Mode (Shipped: 2026-04-08)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 7 plans, 10 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Config.TokenThreshold field (default 4100) with MYHELPER_TOKEN_LIMIT env var, .myhelper/config.json local path, and --token-limit persistent cobra flag
- One-liner:
- Replaced /api/generate client (StreamPrompt) with /api/chat client (StreamChat); all 4 query commands updated to use two-element messages slice (system + user) with history.Message type
- One-liner:
- Multi-turn conversation wired into all 4 query commands via initiateConversation + runConversationLoop pattern
- history.Replace and ollama.Chat(non-streaming) added — the two primitives that runConversationLoop needs to summarize and replace conversation history
- Command-specific summarization prompts and summarize() helper integrated into runConversationLoop — all 4 query commands now automatically condense history when token threshold is exceeded

## v1.0 Initial Release (Shipped: 2026-04-07)

**Phases completed:** 1 phases, 4 plans, 7 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Go module scaffolded with cobra CLI, config loading from env/file/defaults, and streaming Ollama client posting to /api/generate via NDJSON line-scan
- context.md loader (LoadContext) and init subcommand that writes a Go-focused commented template without overwriting existing files
- Four cobra subcommands (plan, lookup, starter, pattern) wired to rootCmd with shared helpers for positional-arg-or-interactive-prompt input and prompt assembly
- One-liner:
